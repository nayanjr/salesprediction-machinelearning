Topic: Black Friday Sales Prediction

***Description:*** Black Friday is an informal term for the Friday after Thanksgiving Day, which is observed on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. On Black Friday, many retailers offer heavily advertised bargains. The study is concerned with calculating product pricing based on previous retail store sales data. 
I will use features like city, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status etc.

# Initial Exploration Overview

Currently included the dataset and performed linear regression to check the performance of the model. The performance as of now is low but adding more features will increase the performance of the model. 

# Linear_regression Overview

Earlier with a single feature Linear Regression accuracy was calculated at 0.02197. After adding 3 features which are  'Stay_In_Current_City_Years','Occupation' and 'Marital_Status' Linear Regression the performace of the model has increased.

# Classification Overview

At this point in my research, I've attempted clustering and dimensional analysis.
The visuals of the Purchases based on different features were exhibited.
