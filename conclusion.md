# Conclusion

1. Around 75 percent of the users who made the purchases are male and remaining 25 percent are female. Most of the purchases were from age group 26-45 and from the city category B. I have used features like city, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status etc.

3. Splitted dataset into random train and test subset of ratio 80:20

4. Implemented multiple supervised models such as Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor

5. For this dataset, random forest performed the best with an accuracy of 67.81
