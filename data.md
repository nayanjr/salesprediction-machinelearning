# Data

1. The dataset contains 12 columns and 1044 rows. 
dtypes: int64(7), object(5)

### Features

1. The features include Product_ID,Gender,Age,Occupation,City_Category,Crime_rate,Stay_In_Current_City_Years,Marital_Status,Product_Category_1,Product_Category_2,Product_Category_3,Purchase

2. I have taken purchase amount as the target using features like city, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status etc.

3. One of the feature is 'Crime_rate' which tells us about the crime rate in that particular city. I see that there is no noticeable relation so discarding that column.
